# StockTrackPro - Static Site Edition

This repository contains the StockTrackPro application converted to a static website that can be hosted on GitHub Pages.

## About StockTrackPro

StockTrackPro is a comprehensive stock analysis and educational platform designed to provide investors with:

- Interactive stock analysis tools
- Technical indicators visualization
- Financial ratio evaluation
- Predictive analytics using machine learning
- Educational resources

## Static Site Version

This static site version allows you to:

1. View pre-generated analyses for popular stocks
2. Access educational content
3. See historical data visualizations
4. Review predictive analytics for selected stocks

**Note**: As a static site, real-time interactivity is limited. The data shown was captured at the time of site generation.

## Pre-Generated Stock Pages

The static site includes pre-analyzed pages for popular stocks such as:
- Apple (AAPL)
- Microsoft (MSFT)
- Google (GOOGL)
- Amazon (AMZN)
- Tesla (TSLA)
- And more!

## Deployment

This site is designed to be automatically deployed to GitHub Pages. The repository includes:

- A GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment
- Daily regeneration to keep data relatively current
- Custom 404 page for improved user experience

For detailed deployment instructions, see [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md).

## How It Works

The static site is generated by:

1. Running the original Streamlit app
2. Capturing the rendered HTML using Selenium
3. Processing the HTML to work as a standalone website
4. Deploying the resulting files to GitHub Pages

For technical details of the implementation, see [STATIC_SITE_SOLUTION.md](STATIC_SITE_SOLUTION.md).
